AI Data Visualization Agent â€“ Streamlit App
Author: Refactored for educational use

This is the entry point for the AI agent app. It integrates the user interface,
session state management, file upload, and LLM-based agent execution.

Block 1: Import required modules and helper components
Block 2: Define the main app function
Block 3: Handle file upload, data preview, and LLM querying
